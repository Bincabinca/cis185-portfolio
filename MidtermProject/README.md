        ## 1. Project Description

        This is a website for playing classic minigames! Said classic games include 
        and are limited to: Snake, Pong, and Platform Jumper. 

        ## 2. Target Audience

        The target audience is people of all ages! Young children, who may not be ready to enter
        the full scope of online gaming, as well as older gamers looking to play their favorite
        classic, nostalgic games.

        ## 3. Main Features
        
        Feature 1: Snake, Pong, Platform Jumper
        Feature 2: Insturctions on how to play each game
        Feature 3: Screenshots of each game for reference
        Feature 4: Fast response and loading times

        ## 4. Technologies Used
        - HTML5: Semantic structure, and building games
        - CSS3: Styling pages, glow and flicker animations for text
        - JavaScript: Creating a clock

        ## 5. File Structure
        
        index.html is the homepage for my website where I have all the games listed with links
        and instructions, and an about section with the purpose of the webpage and my contact info.

        Then I have three separate pages for the games, snake.html, pong.html, and jumper.html.

        The Javascript file includes code for the clock.

        The images file has screenshots from each page, as well as a Minecraft coverart PNG.

        The styles.css file contains all my styles that are used across the pages for consistency.

        ## 6. Challenges Faced

        Trying to make the games mobile friendly was really difficult. I brainstormed
        with the GitHub Copilot and adjusted their suggestions to make it work.

        I also struggled with the gridbox container for a bit trying to customize my layout.
        I was able to do so using grid-template-areas.

        ## 7. AI Tools Used

        The GitHub Copilot was helpful when I would get stuck on code and would
        suggest other solutions (see #6 above).

        ## 8. Future Improvements
        
        If I had more time, I would have liked to tinker a bit more with the games.
        Adding features such as play/pause menus and saving/displaying scores. It was
        a bit advanced for me to do within the given time frame.
        Also adding a larger variety of games!
