        ## 1. Project Description
        What is your website about? (2-3 sentences) Example: "This is a coffee
        shop website for 'Cozy Corner Café'. It showcases our menu, location,
        and story to attract local customers and create an online presence for
        our business."

        This is a website for playing classic minigames! The classic games includes 
        and are limited to: Snake, Pong, and Platform Jumper. 

        ## 2. Target Audience
        Who will use your website? Why? Example: "Local coffee enthusiasts
        aged 20-40 who are looking for a comfortable workspace or meeting
        spot."

        The target audience is young children, who may not be ready for the full scope of gaming,
        as well as older gamers looking to play their favorite classic, nostalgic games.

        ## 3. Main Features
        - Feature 1: (e.g., Interactive menu with prices) - Feature 2: (e.g.,
        Contact form for reservations) - Feature 3: (e.g., Photo gallery of
        the café) - Feature 4: (e.g., Responsive design for mobile)

        ## 4. Technologies Used
        - HTML5 (semantic structure) - CSS3 (styling, animations) - JavaScript
        (form validation, image gallery) - [Any other tools/libraries]

        ## 5. File Structure
        Explain your organization: - index.html - Homepage - menu.html - Menu
        page - about.html - About us page - css/style.css - Main stylesheet -
        js/script.js - JavaScript functionality

        ## 6. Challenges Faced
        What was difficult? How did you solve it? Example: "Making the
        navigation responsive was challenging. I solved it by using CSS
        flexbox and a mobile menu toggle."

        ## 7. AI Tools Used
        List any AI tools and how you used them: - ChatGPT: Used for debugging
        JavaScript form validation - GitHub Copilot: Helped with CSS grid
        layout suggestions - Claude: Assisted with color palette selection -
        None: Did not use any AI tools [Be honest and specific about AI
        assistance]

        The GitHub Copilot was helpful when I would get stuck on codem and would
        suggest other solutions.

        ## 8. Future Improvements
        What would you add with more time? - Online ordering system - Customer
        reviews section - Newsletter signup

        If I had more time, I would have liked to tinker a bit more with the games.
        Adding features such as play/pause menus and saving/displaying scores.
        Also adding a larger variety of games!
