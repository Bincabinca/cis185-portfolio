Compare and contrast (Manual Responsive Design vs Boostrap Responsive Design):
    Manual Responsive Design (MRD) relies on custom CSS to create various layouts. MRD gives you a lot more control but takes a longer amount of time for testing and maintenance. Bootstrap Responsive Design (BRD) provides you with pre-defined grid structures and other components that you need. This speeds up the building process and keeps your builds consitent, but there are limits to what you're able to do. Overall I prefer MRD because I like to have control of and build each aspect myself.
